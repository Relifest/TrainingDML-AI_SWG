The NamedValue is encoded as a JSON object with two properties named "key" and "value". Typically, the "key" property represents a unique identifier or name for the value being described, while the "value" property contains the actual data associated with that identifier. The "key" element is an open field allowing for arbitrary keys to be used. The "value" element may be any types.
