== Scope

This OGC Standard defines an XML encoding of training datasets.  The Standard provides a document model for the exchange of information describing training datasets, both within and between different organizations.

The document model is derived from the conceptual models defined in the OGC Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI) Part 1: Conceptual Model Standard.
